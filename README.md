# What does this repo support?
You can use this repo to deploy your own candy machine UI. 
- It supports multiple candy machine groups, but also just using a default group
- It creates a Lookup table for you to allow more active guards at the same time
- The initializer shows you the merkle root for your groups
- The users see NFTs left, start and end countdowns, reasons for not being able to mint and more
- It supports most of the existing guards
...
- Combining most of these guards is possible since we are lookup tables. For example using `allowlist`,`nftBurn`, `nftPayment`, `solPayment`, `startDate` and `endDate`
- For larger allowlists this UI will automatically split the mint into two transactions to avoid hitting the transaction size limit

# How to use
## Prerequisites
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) as package manager - I used 8.1.0
- [sugar](https://docs.metaplex.com/developer-tools/sugar/guides/sugar-for-cmv3) to create your candy machine

## How to use
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `pnpm install`
3. copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file and fill in the NEXT_PUBLIC_CANDY_MACHINE_ID value. You should have this value after creating your candy machine with sugar. 
3. Run `pnpm run dev`
4. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`
5. Connect your wallet which you used to create the candy machine
6. You should see a red `initialize` button. Click it and then click `create LUT`
7. Copy the LUT address that you see in the green success box and paste it into the `.env` file as the value for `NEXT_PUBLIC_CANDY_MACHINE_CONFIG`
8. Deploy your Candy Machine e.g. to Vercel or Cloudflare Pages
Done!

### customization
You can customize the UI by changing the code. If you just want to modify some values you can instead
- modify `settings.tsx` to change the texts and Image. 
  - `mintText` is for your candy Machine groups. e.g. if one of your groups is called `WL` you should have an entry for it in there, too.
  - `image` is the main image that is shown. You could change it to your project logo.
  - `headerText` is the website header. You could change it to your project name.

### Fees
This ui has a buy me a beer feature. Each mint will transfer a very small amount (0.005) of SOL to a tip wallet. If you do not want to support me feel free to change the NEXT_PUBLIC_BUYMARKBEER variable to false. I would appreachiate it though if you leave it on. üçª
